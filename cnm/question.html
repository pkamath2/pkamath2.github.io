            <h3>Project Details:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the quality of synthetic audio clips generated using an
                artificial neural network. The audio clips under test belong to the domain of audio textures (for e.g. a
                series of
                popping sounds, the ticking sound made by a Geiger counter or the sound made by water filling a
                container).
                This specific goal of this project is to ensure that the synthetic outputs generated by these deep
                learning models
                are validated by human beings to test for certain sound qualities like naturalness and clarity.</p>
            <p>Please use the ‘Contact this requester’ link on the HIT details if you need further details or
                clarifications on the task. The Principal Investigator (the person in charge of this research) or
                his/her
                representative will describe this research to you and answer all of your questions. Note: On using this
                feature, your e-mail address and your name will automatically be visible to our research team so that we
                can reply to you.

                Please read the consent form details and key in your worker ID (indicated at the top left-hand side of
                your browser) before submitting the form to indicate your consent to us. We will not be able to accept
                your work if you have not submitted the consent form.
            </p>
            <p>Note: You need to submit this consent form only ONCE per HIT Group. That means, if you have already
                submitted this once for this HIT group you do not have to do this again.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Task Instructions:</h3>
            <p>In this task you will be presented with a list of few audio clips (e.g. a series of pops or the ticking sounds made by a geiger counter). You will need to select a synthetic clip which sounds better in comparison with the other clip.</p>
            <p>The first audio snippet (marked as Original in blue color) will serve as a reference clip.</p>
            <p>Please listen to each individual audio clip and select which synthetic audio clip sound better than the other synthetic clip in comparsion with the reference clip. </p>

            <h3>Task Instructions:</h3>
            <p>Please ‘accept’ this HIT only if you have access to a laptop or desktop with internal or external
                speakers or headphones. This HIT involves listening and evaluating audio clips.
            </p>
            <p>If you ‘accept’ to work on the HIT, you will be presented with a question which lists out 3 audio clips.
                The first audio clip is called the ‘Original’ audio clip (marked in blue text) and will serve as a
                reference to this question.
            </p>
            <p>You will need to listen to each audio clip and select which synthetic audio clip sound better than the other synthetic clip in comparsion with the reference clip.

            <!--<img src="https://pkamath2.github.io/cnm/grading_rubric.png" />-->

            <p>After you finish selecting an option you will need to submit the HIT.
